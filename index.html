                    <p>Normal guy ho Knows a Bit Coding and 2 minute experience of Stock Trading. I like to work on
                        projects, hang out with friends and family, read books, go on adventures, work on new ideas.</p>
                    <p>Curious about the world at a early age, I was always working on projects and programs in addition
                        to having a profitable career in stock brokerage. Dissatisfied with the classic status quo long
                        ago, I had mastered trading in different markets.(It's a Lie)</p>
                    <p>Aiming to generate financial independence. In the meantime, I work on diversifying my career and
                        skills.</p>

                                The citizens of Shiryokai are the heart and soul of this vibrant city. They are hardworking, dedicated, and passionate about their community.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But in recent years, they've been oppressed by the powerful Elite Corporation. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                               This group of wealthy individuals created a world where technology reigns supreme, and the people's needs have been forgotten. They have replaced jobs with machines, leaving 95% of the population without work and struggling to make ends meet.
                               <br>
                               <br>
                               They're forced to do whatever the Elite wants them to and face horrible consequences if they refuse 
                               <br>
                               <br>
                               They were turned from a fun, loving, and happy community into an oppressed, sad, and starving one.
                               <br>
                               <br>
                               But the citizens of shiryokai have a dream to take back their city and turn it, once again, into a prosperous place full of opportunities and happiness where everyone has access to their basic needs such as water, food, shelter, security, and health. 
                               <br>
                               <br>
                               Beyond what the Elite Corporation tries to make them believe, they understand their lives are valuable and that they're not simple cogs in a machine. 
                               <br>
                               <br>
                               They dream of a future in which technology serves the people's needs and not the other way around, a world where the people's needs come before the desire of the wealthy.

                               <br>
                               <br>
                               They're a beacon of hope in a world flooded with darkness. They're led by a passionate and committed group of leaders that won't conform to living powerless under the oppressive regime of the Elite. The Rebels are determined to take back their city and put power back into the hands of the people. 
                               <br>
                               <br>
                              They understand the importance of community and believe that by coming together, they can create real change. 
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Their fight is a challenging one, and it comes with significant risk. The Elite is a powerful force, and their androids are formidable opponents. But the Rebels are fearless in standing up to the challenge. 
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              They have a deep sense of purpose and a fierce determination to see their mission through. Their goal isn't simply to take down the Elite but to change what isn't working and build a better future for the people of Shiryokai.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              They are fighting to make the dreams and hopes of the people of Shiryokai come true. 
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              The Rebels understand that their fight won't be won overnight. It will take time, effort, and unwavering determination. 
                              <br>
                              <br>
                             But they're up for the challenge. 
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             They're a true force for good and will not rest until justice is served. They are the people's voice, and they won't be silenced. 
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             If you want to make a difference, join the Rebels of Shiryokai in their fight for a better future. Together, we can achieve great things.</div>

                                They're designed and built with precision and care. According to the Elite Corporation, the androids stand as ¬®the guardians of the future¬®. 
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                Their incredible strength, speed, and intelligence make them ideal for tasks that are dangerous or impractical for humans. 
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                The androids are programmed to learn and adapt and constantly improve. With each new upgrade, they become more intelligent, efficient, and effective. But at the cost of becoming less human
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                They're the Elite Corp's perfect tool to force their vision of a better future.

                                 In their ongoing battle against the rebels, the androids have proven to be an unrelenting force. 
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                They are designed to be resistant to damage and are capable of healing themselves quickly. 
                                <br>
                                <br>

                            <div class="description">The Elite is a group of powerful and visionary millionaires who came to power on the promise of working towards a brighter and more prosperous future for humanity.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                They started building their empire on the principles of innovation, creativity, and progress, and they were using their wealth and resources to bring about the changes they believed were necessary.
                                <br>
                                <br>     
                                Their purpose was to create a world where technological advancements were used for the greater good of humanity.
                                <br>
                                <br>    
                                They promised a future where people no longer had to worry about mundane and repetitive jobs and could focus on more creative and fulfilling pursuits.
                                <br>
                                <br>    
                                To achieve this promise, they created Elite Corp, a company dedicated to developing and producing advanced robotics. They invested in developing androids that can perform various tasks, from manual labor to advanced combat operations.
                                <br>
                                <br>           
                                These androids were their answer to the challenges of the future, and they started being developed with a singular purpose in mind: to make the world a better place. The Elite saw the development of these androids as an essential step toward the future.

                                Their greed for power, money, and control, as well as the constant protest of the citizens of Shiryokai against them, made them oppressive, brutal, and tyrannical.
                                <br>
                                <br>                  
                                They now use their technological advancements to control everything they can, oppress the people of Shiryokai and avoid being overthrown.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                They have stopped creating technology that helps improve people's lives and have focused on creating weapons to defend their regime where only the rich can live an extraordinary life while everybody else is living in a nightmare.</div>
